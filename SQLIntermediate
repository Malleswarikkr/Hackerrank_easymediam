problem:Consider  and  to be two points on a 2D plane.

 happens to equal the minimum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in STATION).
 happens to equal the minimum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION).
 happens to equal the maximum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in STATION).
 happens to equal the maximum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION).
Query the Manhattan Distance between points  and  and round it to a scale of 
solution:
select  round((max(lat_n)-min(lat_n))+(max(long_w)-min(long_w)),4) from station 
problem:
Consider  and  to be two points on a 2D plane where  are the respective minimum and maximum values of Northern Latitude (LAT_N) and  are the respective minimum 
and maximum values of Western Longitude (LONG_W) in STATION.Query the Euclidean Distance between points  and  and format your answer to display  decimal digits.
solution:
select round(sqrt(power(max(lat_n)-min(lat_n),2)+power(max(long_w)-min(long_w),2)),4) from station.
problem:
Query the two cities in STATION with the shortest and longest CITY names, as well as their respective lengths (i.e.: number of characters in the name). If there is
more than one smallest or largest city, choose the one that comes first when ordered alphabetically.
solution:
select city,length(city) from station  group by city order by length(city),city limit 1;
select city,length(city) from station  group by city order by length(city) desc,city limit 1;
